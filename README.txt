Modifications + new funcionalities:
I finished the exercise proposed on the slides but also I continue reading the tutorial 
part2 (link on the end of the slides). I added the part of the hearth that flies up from the
sheep when is hit by the hay, some sounds to make the game more attractive and finally I 
included the count score in order to control how many sheeps have been saved and how many
have dropped. When 3 sheeps drop from the ground, the game will be over. When doing the counter,
I had some trouble when the sheep drops because it increment the sheep drop counter by 2 
instead of 1 (to resolve it, I added a boolean called isDrop on the sheep script to control 
when the sheep has drop).

Finally, I added 3 more small windmills and changed the Hay machine model to red.
